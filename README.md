# This repository will contain the dad_weight project.

My dad who has been trying to lose weight has also been keeping notes of his progress. Here I include his raw notes and a script that will walk you 
through some basic data analysis.

1. Plotting data
2. Basic stats of data
3. Slope of data
4. Modeling weight loss
5. Predictions of future weight
